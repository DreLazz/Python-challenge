#                   ***Python-Challenge***
###     In this project, I used Python to create a analysis of financial records and election results.
#                   ***PyBank Instructions***
### 1.  I was tasked with creating a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

###   - The total number of months included in the dataset

###   - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

###   - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

###   - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

###   - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

#                   ***PyPoll Instructions***
### 2.  I was tasked with creating a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

###   - The total number of votes cast

###   - A complete list of candidates who received votes

###   - The percentage of votes each candidate won

###   - The total number of votes each candidate won

###   - The winner of the election based on popular vote

##    Method used:
###   - Python
