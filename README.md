#                   ***Python-Challenge***
#     In this project, I used Python to create a analysis of financial records and election results.
#                   ***PyBank Instructions***
# 1.  I was tasked with creating a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

#   - The total number of months included in the dataset

#   * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

#   + The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

#   - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

#   * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
